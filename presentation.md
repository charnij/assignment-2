Problem 1
=========

*Consider the owner of a small lawn-mowing service. She can use one of two methods to mow lawns. Method 1 is to purchase a tractor that costs €200 a year to own and then spend €1 (for labor and gas) for every acre of grass cut. Method 2 is to spend €40 on a used push mower that will last one year and then spend €5 (for labor) for every acre of grass cut.*  
-----------

1. Write down the total cost functions for the two methods, letting x represent the number of acres of grass cut per year.   
	**Method 1** : 
	$C(x)= 200 + 1x$  

	**Method 2** : 
	$C(x)= 40 + 5x$ 

-------------

2. 	Find the average cost function and the marginal cost for each of the two methods.  

	**Method 1** :   
Average cost: $$(\frac{(200+1x)}{x})$$  
Marginal cost: $MC(x)= 1$

	**Method 2** :   
Average cost: $$(\frac{(40 + 5x)}{x})$$ 
Marginal cost: $MC(x)= 5$

  
Problem 2
============

*Consider a perfectly competitive firm with short-run total costs of $$150 + 2q^2$$.*
----------

1. If the market price is €80, how much output will the firm produce and what will be the firm’s profits?  

MC=MR and MR=P, so P=MC,
This gives us q=20.     
**The firm’s profits equals**  
$P*q – (150 + 2q^2)$  
$80 * 20 – (150 + 2 * 20^2) = 650$

---------

2. 	Below which price does the firm shut down (stops to produce in the short run)?  

The firm will shut down when $$P<AVC$$.  
ACV= $$(\frac{150}{q}) + 2q$$  
**So, the firm shuts down when**  
$$P<(\frac{150}{20} + 2*20$$, thus $$P<47,5$$
