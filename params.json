She can use one of two methods to mow lawns. Method 1 is to purchase a tractor that costs €200 a year to own and then spend €1 (for labor and gas) for every acre of grass cut. Method 2 is to spend €40 on a used push mower that will last one year and then spend €5 (for labor) for every acre of grass cut.*\r\n\r\n1. Write down the total cost functions for the two methods, letting x represent the number of acres of grass cut per year.   \r\n\t**Method 1** : \r\n\t$C(x)= 200 + 1x$  \r\n\r\n\t**Method 2** : \r\n\t$C(x)= 40 + 5x$ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. \tFind the average cost function and the marginal cost for each of the two methods.  \r\n\r\n\t**Method 1** :   \r\nAverage cost: $$(\\frac{(200+1x)}{x})$$  \r\nMarginal cost: $MC(x)= 1$\r\n\r\n\t**Method 2** :   \r\nAverage cost: $$(\\frac{(40 + 5x)}{x})$$ \r\nMarginal cost: $MC(x)= 5$\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n###Problem 2\r\n------\r\n*Consider a perfectly competitive firm with short-run total costs of $$150 + 2q^2$$.*\r\n\r\n1. If the market price is €80, how much output will the firm produce and what will be the firm’s profits?  \r\n\r\nMC=MR and MR=P, so P=MC,\r\nThis gives us q=20.     \r\n**The firm’s profits equals**  \r\n$P*q – (150 + 2q^2)$  \r\n$80 * 20 – (150 + 2 * 20^2) = 650$\r\n\r\n2. \tBelow which price does the firm shut down (stops to produce in the short run)?  \r\n\r\nThe firm will shut down when $$P<AVC$$.  \r\n$$AVC = (\\frac{150}{q}) + 2q$$  \r\n**So, the firm shuts down when**  \r\n$$P<(\\frac{150}{20} + 2*20$$, thus $$P<47,5$$",
